In cell manufacturing, there are usually 2 units of measure: trays and stacks. There are 64 cells inside a tray, and 8 trays inside a stack.
 
Often times, the cell manufacturing team needs to place “holds” on trays due to certain quality reasons. When you place a hold on a tray, you must provide a reason for why that hold is being placed. A tray can only have a single hold placed on it at one time.
The business also wants to be able to place holds on stacks as a single operation. This would essentially mean that a hold must be placed on all 8 trays in a stack.
 
The business would like to store information about trays, the stacks those trays are in, and on holds. Particularly, they would like to see a complete history of every single hold a tray has had on it. How would you go about storing all this information in a database?
 
Important queries that may be performed are:
* Get all the trays with current holds on them
* Get all the stacks with current holds on them
* Tell if a tray currently has a hold on it
* Get me the latest time a particular tray was held
 
What are the database operations you would perform to:
 
* Put a hold on a tray
* Release a hold on a tray
* Place a hold on a stack
* Release a hold on a stack
